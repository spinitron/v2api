    ## Notes

    **Tutorial demo** using this API is at [https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/). For web integration using iframes and/or JavaScript instead of an API, see [https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/](https://spinitron.github.io/v2-web-integration/).

    **Your API key** is found in the Spinitron web app. Log in to Spinitron and go to *Automation & API* in the *Admin* menu.

    **Authenticate** by presenting your API key using either HTTP Bearer Authorization
    (preferred)

        curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOURAPIKEY' 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins'

    or in the query parameter `access-token` (less secure owing to webserver
    log files)

        curl 'https://spinitron.com/api/spins?access-token=YOURAPIKEY'

    **Limit** per page of results is 20 by default and miximally 200.

    **Try it out** below works to
    generate example cURL requests but not to get responses from Spinitron. We
    do not accept queries sent from web browsers. Copy-paste the cURL commands
    and run them from your computer.

    **Cache** the data you get from the API if you are using it in web or mobile integration. It's not ok to query the API on *every* page request you serve. The [demo](https://spinitron.com/v2-api-demo/) shows how easy it can be to implement a file cache.

    An extension to this API with access to all stations for partner applications is available. Contact us.

  /shows:
    get:
      summary: >-
        Returns scheduled shows optionally filtered by {start} and/or {end}
        datetimes
      description: >
        **Terminology**: Spinitron defines a *show* as a radio program. A show
        can have one or more *schedules*,

        each of which may specify either an *occurence* or a *repetition*, which
        represents a set of occurences.

        Thus scheduled shows have occurences that, for example, may be displayed
        in a calendar.


        In the response, `items` is an array of objects representing occurences
        of scheduled shows.


        You may optionally filter `items` to a datetime *range* by including in
        the request {start} and/or {end}

        parameters, both of which must be no more than one hour in the past. An
        occurence starting at {end} is

        included in the reponse.


        `itmes` can include occurences that begin *or* end within the filter
        range. A show that goes on air before

        {start} appears in `items` if it ends *after* but not *at* {start}. An
        occurence starting at or before {end}

        is included.


        If the request omits the {start} parameter, the server sets its value to
        the current time so that the filter

        range's start is always defined. If the request specifies {end} then the
        requested range is *bounded*,

        otherwise it is *unbounded*.


        For a bounded request, `items` includes *every* occurence of all shows
        occuring in the range. The only

        difference between objects in `items` representing a given show will be
        the `start` field value.


        For an unbounded request, `items` includes *only one* occurence per
        show, specifically, the

        next occurrence after {start} of all shows occuring after {start}.


        Use an unbounded request to get a straight list all shows. Use a bounded
        request to get a calendar/agenda

        of shows expanded into occurrences by thir shedules and repetitions.


        Objects in `items` are ordered first by `datetime` and then by `id`.
